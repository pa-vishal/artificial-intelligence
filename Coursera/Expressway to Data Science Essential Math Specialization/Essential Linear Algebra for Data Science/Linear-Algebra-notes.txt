C1V1+C2V2+....+CnVn = b

Linear Combinations:  are there any Ci that when multiplied to given vectors give a different vector.
Vectors => known
b => known 
Ci  = ?

we convert the Ci*Vi equation to coefficient matrix form and put b as augmented column to make it augmneted matrix. 
Then we solve it by Guassian Elimination.

Span:  what all possible b vectors when each Ci is given a different value
Vi => known
Ci => known (we try different values here. 
b [] = []?


Ax=b : find values for vector x (in another words - A multiplied by x will that equal to b for any b,  what is the solution set of b that is allowed ) :
V or x []= []?  (this is x with just a single vector)
Ci => known
b  => known
