		Function Intro
		Domain and Range
		Piecewise functions
		What Can You Do to a Function? (add multiply forms of 0 and 1 to solve fn)
		Multiply Binomials (Polinomials) - (a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2

Week 2
	Induction Proofs, Limits and Continuity-Simple induction proofs and limits at infinity for functions
		Induction Proofs
			Proof by Induction
		Limits at Infinity		
		Limits at a Specific Point
		Continuity of a Function
				
Week 3
	Definition of a Derivative
		Intro to Derivatives
		Derivative of a Simple Function
			f(x) = -x^2 + 3x and f'(x) = -2x + 3
		Derivative of an Exponential Function
			What is the derivative of  f(x)=5e^x -> 5e^x  
		Derivative of a Constant
			f(x)=2, f'(x)=0
			f(x)=x^2 + 2, f'(x)=2x
			
		f(x)=x^3 -3x + 4e^x, f'(x)=3x^2 -3 + 4e^x
