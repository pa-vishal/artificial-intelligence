What is a Function? (Algebraically and Graphically)

function operates on an input and gives you a result, that's one result for the input that you give it. 
The result could be repeated, but it can't be indeterminate

For a curve to be called a graph of a function, it should pass vertical line test.
 In this case, if a vertical line is drawn on the curve, if the point intersects the curve more than once, then curve does not represent a function. 
A function f(x) needs to have one to one mapping between X (x1, x2...) and Y (y1,y2...). Each point x should have only one point y from f(x). 

The valid parabola equation that is a function is: 
	
	y=ax2+bx+c=0, where a!=0. This is the graph of a function.
